;;; Commentary:

;; Install:
;; =======
;; Put this file in your load-path
;; Add to your .emacs:
;;
;; (require 'traverselisp)
;;
;; Here is my config with version-1.13:
;; ===================================
;; (require 'traverselisp)
;; (setq traverse-use-avfs t)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<f12> f") 'traverse-deep-rfind)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<f12> u") 'traverse-build-tags-in-project)
;; (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c t") 'traverse-dired-search-regexp-in-anything-at-point)
;; (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-z") 'traverse-dired-browse-archive)
;; (add-to-list 'traverse-ignore-files ".ledger-cache")

;; You can use customize to set some variables : (eval with C-x C-e)
;; (customize-group "traversedir")

;; Usage:
;; =====
;; M-x traverse-deep-rfind
;; When searching is done and you are in traverse buffer
;; some actions are provided for navigate and for replacing regexps
;; Use "C-h m" for more info while in traverse-buffer.
;;
;; You can also use traverse from Dired:
;; M-x traverse-dired-search-regexp-in-anything-at-point
;; This function work on directory, files, (1)compressed files (avfs)
;; M-x traverse-dired-browse-archive
;; This function use (1)avfs to browse archive tar.gz, bz2 etc..
;; Other functions are provided:
;; `traverse-cp-or-mv-extfiles-in-dir'
;; `traverse-build-tags-in-project'
;;
;; (1)NOTE: You have to install avfs and enable fuse in your kernel if
;; you want to browse and search in archives.
;; Please see the doc of your distrib.
;; and the doc of avfs
;; http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf
